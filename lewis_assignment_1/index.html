      Scalable Vector Graphics or the shortened named used SVG, are vector
      format images. SVG's are an XML based format. SVG is vector based, which
      means that it is resolution independent. SVG does not use bit-mapped based
      images, it uses mathematics to make the images, which makes it scale
      indefinitely. Due to this the images will be super sharp no matter how
      much you scale the image up or down.

      There are many reasons to use SVG images for your website purposes. One of
      the main reasons is that SVG's are scalable indefinitely without ruining
      the image, the image will stay super sharp no matter how much you scale
      the image up or down. Due to the accessibility to scale the SVG image up
      or down as small or large as you want they are the perfect choice to make
      a logo with for companies that rely on adding their logo to an infinite
      amount of things in the future for marketing and advertising. Since they
      are able to be scaled indefinitely they are able to be scaled or edited
      anytime in the future with ease. Since SVG's are vector based they are
      normally smaller in file size. SVG's can be styled using CSS also. You are
      able to add keywords, descriptions, and links to the markup, so that makes
      them really great for SEO. SVG's are able to be embedded into HTML, so
      they can be indexed for accessibility, edited using CSS, and can also be
      cached. They can also be made to be animated also. These are many reasons
      to choose SVG format for your next project.
